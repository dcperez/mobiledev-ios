# TicketChamp
<p align="center">An event ticketing app for iOS</p>

## Introduction
The goal was to learn how to create the frontend using UIKit and the Interface Builder, while integrating data from available APIs and databases. The team took on the challenege of creating an application that will display local events where a user can eventually purchase a ticket, similarly to other applications such as StubHub and Ticketmaster.

## Objective
Create a native iOS location-based ticketing application that will communicate with the Ticketmaster API and work with Firebase, a backend-as-a-service platform.
